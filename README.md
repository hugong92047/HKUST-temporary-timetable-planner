The underlying courses.js file is currently generated via a Python web scraper that retrieves data from the HKUST Class Schedule & Quota page (https://w5.ab.ust.hk/wcq/cgi-bin/2530/). 
While this currently requires a manual update at the start of each semester, I plan to fully automate this data synchronization process in the future.
