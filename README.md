This planner serves as a temporary alternative following the end of support for the HKUST Timetable add-on. 
Please be aware that certain features, such as lecture-tutorial/lab matching and course exclusions, are currently under development. 
I am working to implement these functions as quickly as possible. However, please note that saved data may be cleared during these maintenance updates.

The underlying courses.js file is currently generated via a Python web scraper that retrieves data from the HKUST Class Schedule & Quota page (https://w5.ab.ust.hk/wcq/cgi-bin/2530/). 
While this currently requires a manual update at the start of each semester, I plan to fully automate this data synchronization process in the future.
